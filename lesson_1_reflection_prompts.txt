How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It makes it easier to find the lines where changes were made.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    it saves time in comparing versions and makes it easy to go back to working versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros - you control what is saved and so the saved data is relevant and you dont have unnecessary versions saved.
	cons - you may loose important data and hard work if you forget to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    the porpose of git is to mainly control versions of code projects which typically have more that one file involved and different files have impact on one another.
